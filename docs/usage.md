# Usage

## Why Make A Sim Wrapper At All?

As alluded to in the {doc}`quickstart <quickstart>`, `pytest-amaranth-sim`
doesn't do that much on its own. However, I've found `pytest` {doc}`fixtures <pytest:reference/fixtures>`
to be extremely effective in deduplicating test setup code and to create more 
test cases. So I went ahead and created this plugin based on my own experiences
repeatedly implementing small fixtures, so that all my shared code is in one
place.

## Fixtures

`pytest-amaranth-sim` provides the following fixtures and class (`SimulatorFixture`)
for controlling Amaranth simulations:

```{eval-rst}
.. automodule:: pytest_amaranth_sim.plugin
   :exclude-members: pytest_addoption, pytest_make_parametrize_id
```

### How To Use These Fixtures

A basic test using this plugin looks something like this:

```
class MyMod(Elaboratable):
    def __init__(self, width=4, registered=True):
        ...

    def elaborate(self, plat):
        m = Module()

        ...

        return m

@pytest.fixture
def tb(mod, request):
    async def inner(sim):
        s = sim
        m = mod

        ...

        # Use s object to drive simulation forward.
        await s.tick()

        # Assert statements to test m.
        assert ...

    return inner

@pytest.mark.parametrize("mod,clks", [(MyMod(), 1.0 / 12e6)])
def test_tb(sim, tb):
    sim.run(testbenches=[tb])
```

```{todo} Work on the prose of this section. Bullet points are a shortcut.
```

Of note: 

* Tests are expected to end with `sim.run()`, where most of the actual test
  is executed.
* Tests must be parameterized _at least_ in terms of `mod`, and probably `clks`
  as well (unless testing combinational code).
* From the simulator's POV, testbenches and processes are expected to be a
  function of a single argument (async) or no argument (generator).

Due to the simulator expecting functions of a single or no argument,
testbenches and processes generally are defined as [inner functions](https://docs.python.org/3.9/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions), returned from an outer function (or passed
directly to `sim.run()`). In the above snippet, the inner function is `inner`
and the outer function is `tb`.

By using inner functions, testbenches and processes can be customized from
multiple sources:

* The [`request` fixture](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/reference.html#std-fixture-request).
  This is useful when paired with [`pytest.mark.parametrize`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/parametrize.html#pytest-mark-parametrize-parametrizing-test-functions) or [indirect parameterization](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/example/parametrize.html#indirect-parametrization).
* From other fixtures when parameterizing tests [directly](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/fixtures.html#override-a-fixture-with-direct-test-parametrization).
* Direct input arguments to the outer function. This is useful when outer
  isn't a fixture. The outer function would be invoked inside a test body
  (`test_tb` in the above snippet) and return your testbenches and processes
  to be passed to `sim.run()`.
* If your given test body has enough fixtures and parameterization, the test
  itself can be the outer function, and testbenches and processes can be
  defined in-line in the test body!

## Command Line Options

* `--vcds`: Generate [Value Change Dump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump) files
  from simulations. These can be viewed in a VCD viewer like [GTKWave](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/)
  or [Surfer](https://gitlab.com/surfer-project/surfer). The filenames of the
  VCD files will be derived from the names of tests run in the current session.

## Configuration File Settings

The following {doc}`configuration options <pytest:reference/customize>`
are available:

* `long_vcd_filenames`: VCD and GTKW files generated have longer, but less
  ambiguous filenames (`bool`).
* `extend_vcd_time`: Work around [GTKWave behavior](https://github.com/gtkwave/gtkwave/issues/230)
  to truncate VCD traces that end on a transition (`string`, femtoseconds to
  extend trace).
